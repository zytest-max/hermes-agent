"""Windows-safe stdio configuration.

On Windows, Python's ``sys.stdout``/``sys.stderr`` default to the console's
active code page (often ``cp1252``, sometimes ``cp437``, occasionally ``cp932``
on Japanese locales, etc.).  Hermes's banners, tool output feed, and slash
command listings all contain Unicode: box-drawing characters (``─┌┐└┘├┤``),
mathematical and geometric symbols (``◆ ◇ ◎ ▣ ⚔ ⚖ →``), and user-supplied
text in any language.  Printing those to a cp1252 console raises
``UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character…`` and kills the
whole CLI before the REPL even opens.

The fix is to force UTF-8 on the Python side and also flip the console's
code page to UTF-8 (65001).  Both matter: Python-level only helps when
Python's stdout is a real TTY; code-page flipping lets subprocesses and
child Python ``print()`` calls agree on encoding.

This module is a no-op on every non-Windows platform, and idempotent.
Entry points (``cli.py`` ``main``, ``hermes_cli/main.py`` CLI dispatch,
``gateway/run.py`` startup) call :func:`configure_windows_stdio` exactly
once early in startup.

Patterns cribbed from Claude Code (``src/utils/platform.ts``), OpenCode
(``packages/opencode/src/pty/index.ts`` env injection), and OpenAI Codex
(``codex-rs/core/src/unified_exec/process_manager.rs``).  None of those
actually flip the console code page — they rely on their runtime (Node or
Rust) writing UTF-16 to the Win32 console API and letting the terminal
sort it out.  Python doesn't get that luxury.
