"""Augmentations to prompt_toolkit's input-parsing tables.

Imported once at CLI startup. Each helper installs a small mapping into
prompt_toolkit's `ANSI_SEQUENCES` so byte sequences emitted by modern
keyboard protocols (Kitty / xterm `modifyOtherKeys`) decode to existing
key tuples Hermes already binds.

Kept in a standalone module — separate from `cli.py` — so the registrations
can be unit-tested without importing the whole CLI runtime.

    """Map Shift+Enter byte sequences to the (Escape, ControlM) key tuple
    that Alt+Enter produces, so the existing Alt+Enter newline handler
    fires for terminals that emit a distinct Shift+Enter.

    Sequences mapped:
      - "\\x1b[13;2u"     — Kitty keyboard protocol / CSI-u, modifier=2 (Shift)
      - "\\x1b[27;2;13~"  — xterm modifyOtherKeys=2, modifier=2 (Shift)
      - "\\x1b[27;2;13u"  — alternate ordering some emitters use

    The CSI-u sequence is not in stock prompt_toolkit. The modifyOtherKeys
    variant `\\x1b[27;2;13~` IS in stock prompt_toolkit but mapped to plain
    `Keys.ControlM` — i.e. Shift+Enter behaves identically to Enter, which
    is the very bug this helper exists to fix. We therefore overwrite
    those two specific keys (and `\\x1b[27;2;13u`) unconditionally; other
    `\\x1b[27;...;13~` sequences (Ctrl+Enter, Alt+Enter via modifyOtherKeys
    variants 5/6/etc.) are left untouched.

    Default macOS Terminal and stock Windows Terminal still send the same
    byte for Enter and Shift+Enter, so there is no fix for those terminals
    at the application layer — the sequences above never reach Hermes.

    Currently covers focus reports:
      - ``\\x1b[I`` — terminal regained focus (focus in)
      - ``\\x1b[O`` — terminal lost focus (focus out)

    Ghostty, iTerm2, and some xterm builds can emit these sequences when
    the user switches tabs / windows or when a multiplexer toggles focus
    tracking upstream. prompt_toolkit does not map these by default, so
    its parser falls back to literal key presses (ESC, ``[``, ``I``/``O``)
    and inserts ``[I``/``[O`` into the prompt buffer after the ESC byte
    is handled.

    Registering them as ``Keys.Ignore`` is parser-level — strictly
    cleaner than post-hoc regex stripping in the input sanitizer because
    the bytes never reach the buffer. ``setdefault`` is used so any user
    or downstream registration wins.
