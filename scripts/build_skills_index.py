"""Build the Hermes Skills Index — a centralized JSON catalog of all skills.

This script crawls every skill source (skills.sh, GitHub taps, official,
clawhub, lobehub, claude-marketplace) and writes a JSON index with resolved
GitHub paths. The index is served as a static file on the docs site so that
`hermes skills search/install` can use it without hitting the GitHub API.

Usage:
    # Local (uses gh CLI or GITHUB_TOKEN for auth)
    python scripts/build_skills_index.py

    # CI (set GITHUB_TOKEN as secret)
    GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_... python scripts/build_skills_index.py

Output: website/static/api/skills-index.json
