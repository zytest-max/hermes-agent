"""Regression tests for the _run_async() event-loop lifecycle.

These tests verify the fix for GitHub issue #2104:
  "Event loop is closed" after vision_analyze used as first call in session.

Root cause: asyncio.run() creates and *closes* a fresh event loop on every
call.  Cached httpx/AsyncOpenAI clients that were bound to the now-dead loop
would crash with RuntimeError("Event loop is closed") when garbage-collected.

The fix replaces asyncio.run() with a persistent event loop in _run_async().
