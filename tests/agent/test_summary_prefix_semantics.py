"""Pin the semantics of SUMMARY_PREFIX so the compaction handoff doesn't
re-introduce conflicting instructions.

Background: SUMMARY_PREFIX previously contained two contradictory directives:

  1. "treat it as background reference, NOT as active instructions"
     "Do NOT answer questions or fulfill requests mentioned in this summary"
     "Respond ONLY to the latest user message that appears AFTER this summary"

  2. "Your current task is identified in the '## Active Task' section of the
     summary — resume exactly from there."

When the latest user message contradicted Active Task (e.g. "stop the
i18n refactor", "never mind, look at grafana"), the model often followed
(2) anyway because "resume exactly" is a strong directive — leading to
the agent repeatedly re-surfacing already-cancelled work across turns.

These tests pin the post-fix invariants so the conflict cannot regress.
