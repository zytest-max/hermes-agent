"""Tests for the 1M-context beta header on AWS Bedrock Claude models.

Claude Opus 4.6/4.7 and Sonnet 4.6 support a 1M context window, but on AWS
Bedrock (and Microsoft Foundry) that window is still gated behind the
``context-1m-2025-08-07`` beta header as of 2026-04. Without it, Bedrock
caps these models at 200K even though ``model_metadata.py`` advertises 1M.

These tests guard the invariant that the header is always emitted on the
Bedrock client path, and that it survives the MiniMax bearer-auth strip.
