"""Behavior tests for the skill review / combined review prompts.

The review prompts steer the background review agent toward actively updating
the skill library after most sessions, with a strong bias toward:
  1. Patching currently-loaded skills first,
  2. Patching existing umbrellas next,
  3. Adding references/ files under an existing umbrella,
  4. Creating a new class-level umbrella only when nothing else fits.

User-preference corrections (style, format, verbosity, legibility) are
first-class skill signals, not just memory signals.

These tests assert behavioral *instructions* are present — they do NOT
snapshot the full prompt text (change-detector).
