"""Tests for ruff lint config — guards against accidental rule removal.

PLW1514 (unspecified-encoding) was enabled after a debug session on
Windows turned up three separate UTF-8 regressions in execute_code.
The rule catches bare ``open()`` / ``read_text()`` / ``write_text()``
calls that default to locale encoding — cp1252 on Windows — which
silently corrupts non-ASCII content.

These tests ensure:
  1. PLW1514 stays in ``[tool.ruff.lint.select]``
  2. The CI workflow's blocking step still invokes ``ruff check .``
  3. pyproject.toml has ``preview = true`` (required — PLW1514 is a
     preview rule in ruff 0.15.x)

If someone removes any of these, CI stops enforcing UTF-8-explicit
opens and we're back to the original Windows-regression trap.
