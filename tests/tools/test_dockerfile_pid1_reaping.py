"""Contract tests for the container Dockerfile.

These tests assert invariants about how the Dockerfile composes its runtime —
they deliberately avoid snapshotting specific package versions, line numbers,
or exact flag choices.  What they DO assert is that the Dockerfile maintains
the properties required for correct production behaviour:

- A PID-1 init is installed and wraps the entrypoint, so that orphaned
  subprocesses (MCP stdio servers, git, bun, browser daemons) get reaped
  instead of accumulating as zombies (#15012).
- Signal forwarding runs through the init so ``docker stop`` triggers
  hermes's own graceful-shutdown path.

The init can be any reaper-capable PID-1: the historical lineage was
``tini``; the current image uses s6-overlay's ``/init`` (which execs
``s6-svscan`` as PID 1, with the same SIGCHLD-reaping property). The
checks below accept either family — the contract is behavioural, not
nominal.
