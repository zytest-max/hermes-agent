"""Tool-surface cwd contract tests for gateway workspaces.

These cover the platform-neutral part of #29265: once the gateway has resolved
``TERMINAL_CWD``, the user-visible tool surfaces should agree on that workspace.

Unlike the system-prompt readers fixed in the gateway-cwd-resolver cluster
(agent/runtime_cwd.py), these tool sites already read ``TERMINAL_CWD``-first and
were deliberately left out of scope. This file is a *characterization* guard: it
pins the already-correct behavior so the supersession of PR #29365 is airtight
and a future refactor of these sites can't silently regress the contract.
