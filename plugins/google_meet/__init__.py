"""google_meet plugin — let the agent join a Meet call, transcribe it, follow up.

v1: transcribe-only. Spawns a headless Chromium via Playwright, joins the Meet
URL, enables live captions, scrapes them into a transcript file. The agent then
has the transcript in its workspace and can do whatever followup work it needs
using its regular tools.

v2 (not in this PR): realtime duplex audio so the agent can speak in the
meeting, via OpenAI Realtime / Gemini Live + BlackHole / PulseAudio null-sink.
``meet_say`` exists as a stub today so the tool surface is stable.

Explicit-by-design: only joins ``https://meet.google.com/`` URLs explicitly
passed in. No calendar scanning, no auto-dial, no consent announcement.
