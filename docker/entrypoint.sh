# s6-overlay shim. The real logic lives in docker/stage2-hook.sh, invoked
# by /etc/cont-init.d/01-hermes-setup (installed by the Dockerfile). This
# file exists so external references to docker/entrypoint.sh still work,
# but it's no longer the ENTRYPOINT — /init is.
#
# When called directly (e.g. by an old wrapper script that hard-coded
# docker/entrypoint.sh as the container ENTRYPOINT, or by an external
# orchestration script that invokes it inside the container), forward to
# the stage2 hook for parity with the pre-s6 entrypoint behavior. The
# stage2 hook only handles cont-init bootstrap (UID remap, chown, config
# seed, skills sync); it does NOT exec the CMD. Callers that depended
# on the pre-s6 contract "entrypoint.sh sets up state then execs hermes"
# will see the bootstrap happen but the CMD will not run from this shim.
#
# Deprecation: this shim is preserved for one release cycle to give
# downstream users time to migrate their wrappers to the image's real
# ENTRYPOINT (`/init`). It will be removed in a future major release.
# Surface a warning to stderr so anyone still invoking this path
# sees the migration notice in their logs.
