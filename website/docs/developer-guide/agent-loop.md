# Agent Loop Internals

The core orchestration engine is `run_agent.py`'s `AIAgent` class — a large file that handles everything from prompt assembly to tool dispatch to provider failover.

## Core Responsibilities

`AIAgent` is responsible for:

- Assembling the effective system prompt and tool schemas via `prompt_builder.py`
- Selecting the correct provider/API mode (chat_completions, codex_responses, anthropic_messages)
- Making interruptible model calls with cancellation support
- Executing tool calls (sequentially or concurrently via thread pool)
- Maintaining conversation history in OpenAI message format
- Handling compression, retries, and fallback model switching
- Tracking iteration budgets across parent and child agents
- Flushing persistent memory before context is lost

## Two Entry Points

```python
# Simple interface — returns final response string
response = agent.chat("Fix the bug in main.py")

# Full interface — returns dict with messages, metadata, usage stats
result = agent.run_conversation(
    user_message="Fix the bug in main.py",
    system_message=None,           # auto-built if omitted
    conversation_history=None,      # auto-loaded from session if omitted
    task_id="task_abc123"
)
```

`chat()` is a thin wrapper around `run_conversation()` that extracts the `final_response` field from the result dict.

## API Modes

Hermes supports three API execution modes, resolved from provider selection, explicit args, and base URL heuristics:

| API mode | Used for | Client type |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `chat_completions` | OpenAI-compatible endpoints (OpenRouter, custom, most providers) | `openai.OpenAI` |
| `codex_responses` | OpenAI Codex / Responses API | `openai.OpenAI` with Responses format |
| `anthropic_messages` | Native Anthropic Messages API | `anthropic.Anthropic` via adapter |

The mode determines how messages are formatted, how tool calls are structured, how responses are parsed, and how caching/streaming works. All three converge on the same internal message format (OpenAI-style `role`/`content`/`tool_calls` dicts) before and after API calls.

**Mode resolution order:**
1. Explicit `api_mode` constructor arg (highest priority)
2. Provider-specific detection (e.g., `anthropic` provider → `anthropic_messages`)
3. Base URL heuristics (e.g., `api.anthropic.com` → `anthropic_messages`)
4. Default: `chat_completions`

## Turn Lifecycle

Each iteration of the agent loop follows this sequence:

```text
run_conversation()
  1. Generate task_id if not provided
  2. Append user message to conversation history
  3. Build or reuse cached system prompt (prompt_builder.py)
  4. Check if preflight compression is needed (>50% context)
  5. Build API messages from conversation history
     - chat_completions: OpenAI format as-is
     - codex_responses: convert to Responses API input items
     - anthropic_messages: convert via anthropic_adapter.py
  6. Inject ephemeral prompt layers (budget warnings, context pressure)
  7. Apply prompt caching markers if on Anthropic
  8. Make interruptible API call (_interruptible_api_call)
  9. Parse response:
     - If tool_calls: execute them, append results, loop back to step 5
     - If text response: persist session, flush memory if needed, return
```

### Message Format

All messages use OpenAI-compatible format internally:

```python
{"role": "system", "content": "..."}
{"role": "user", "content": "..."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "...", "tool_calls": [...]}
{"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "...", "content": "..."}
```

Reasoning content (from models that support extended thinking) is stored in `assistant_msg["reasoning"]` and optionally displayed via the `reasoning_callback`.

### Message Alternation Rules

The agent loop enforces strict message role alternation:

- After the system message: `User → Assistant → User → Assistant → ...`
- During tool calling: `Assistant (with tool_calls) → Tool → Tool → ... → Assistant`
- **Never** two assistant messages in a row
- **Never** two user messages in a row
- **Only** `tool` role can have consecutive entries (parallel tool results)

Providers validate these sequences and will reject malformed histories.

## Interruptible API Calls

API requests are wrapped in `_interruptible_api_call()` which runs the actual HTTP call in a background thread while monitoring an interrupt event:

```text
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Main thread                  API thread           │
│                                                    │
│   wait on:                     HTTP POST           │
│    - response ready     ───▶   to provider         │
│    - interrupt event                               │
│    - timeout                                       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

When interrupted (user sends new message, `/stop` command, or signal):
- The API thread is abandoned (response discarded)
- The agent can process the new input or shut down cleanly
- No partial response is injected into conversation history

## Tool Execution

### Sequential vs Concurrent

When the model returns tool calls:

- **Single tool call** → executed directly in the main thread
- **Multiple tool calls** → executed concurrently via `ThreadPoolExecutor`
  - Exception: tools marked as interactive (e.g., `clarify`) force sequential execution
  - Results are reinserted in the original tool call order regardless of completion order

### Execution Flow

```text
for each tool_call in response.tool_calls:
    1. Resolve handler from tools/registry.py
    2. Fire pre_tool_call plugin hook
    3. Check if dangerous command (tools/approval.py)
       - If dangerous: invoke approval_callback, wait for user
    4. Execute handler with args + task_id
    5. Fire post_tool_call plugin hook
    6. Append {"role": "tool", "content": result} to history
```

### Agent-Level Tools

Some tools are intercepted by `run_agent.py` *before* reaching `handle_function_call()`:

| Tool | Why intercepted |
|------|--------------------|
| `todo` | Reads/writes agent-local task state |
| `memory` | Writes to persistent memory files with character limits |
| `session_search` | Queries session history via the agent's session DB |
| `delegate_task` | Spawns subagent(s) with isolated context |

These tools modify agent state directly and return synthetic tool results without going through the registry.

## Callback Surfaces

`AIAgent` supports platform-specific callbacks that enable real-time progress in the CLI, gateway, and ACP integrations:

| Callback | When fired | Used by |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `tool_progress_callback` | Before/after each tool execution | CLI spinner, gateway progress messages |
| `thinking_callback` | When model starts/stops thinking | CLI "thinking..." indicator |
| `reasoning_callback` | When model returns reasoning content | CLI reasoning display, gateway reasoning blocks |
| `clarify_callback` | When `clarify` tool is called | CLI input prompt, gateway interactive message |
| `step_callback` | After each complete agent turn | Gateway step tracking, ACP progress |
| `stream_delta_callback` | Each streaming token (when enabled) | CLI streaming display |
| `tool_gen_callback` | When tool call is parsed from stream | CLI tool preview in spinner |
| `status_callback` | State changes (thinking, executing, etc.) | ACP status updates |

## Budget and Fallback Behavior

### Iteration Budget

The agent tracks iterations via `IterationBudget`:

- Default: 90 iterations (configurable via `agent.max_turns`)
- Each agent gets its own budget. Subagents get independent budgets capped at `delegation.max_iterations` (default 50) — total iterations across parent + subagents can exceed the parent's cap
- At 100%, the agent stops and returns a summary of work done

### Fallback Model

When the primary model fails (429 rate limit, 5xx server error, 401/403 auth error):

1. Check `fallback_providers` list in config
2. Try each fallback in order
3. On success, continue the conversation with the new provider
4. On 401/403, attempt credential refresh before failing over

The fallback system also covers auxiliary tasks independently — vision, compression, and web extraction each have their own fallback chain configurable via the `auxiliary.*` config section.

## Compression and Persistence

### When Compression Triggers

- **Preflight** (before API call): If conversation exceeds 50% of model's context window
- **Gateway auto-compression**: If conversation exceeds 85% (more aggressive, runs between turns)

### What Happens During Compression

1. Memory is flushed to disk first (preventing data loss)
2. Middle conversation turns are summarized into a compact summary
3. The last N messages are preserved intact (`compression.protect_last_n`, default: 20)
4. Tool call/result message pairs are kept together (never split)
5. A new session lineage ID is generated (compression creates a "child" session)

### Session Persistence

After each turn:
- Messages are saved to the session store (SQLite via `hermes_state.py`)
- Memory changes are flushed to `MEMORY.md` / `USER.md`
- The session can be resumed later via `/resume` or `hermes chat --resume`
