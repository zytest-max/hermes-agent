"""Environment variable passthrough registry.

Skills that declare ``required_environment_variables`` in their frontmatter
need those vars available in sandboxed execution environments (execute_code,
terminal).  By default both sandboxes strip secrets from the child process
environment for security.  This module provides a session-scoped allowlist
so skill-declared vars (and user-configured overrides) pass through.

Two sources feed the allowlist:

1. **Skill declarations** — when a skill is loaded via ``skill_view``, its
   ``required_environment_variables`` are registered here automatically.
2. **User config** — ``terminal.env_passthrough`` in config.yaml lets users
   explicitly allowlist vars for non-skill use cases.

Both ``code_execution_tool.py`` and ``tools/environments/local.py`` consult
:func:`is_env_passthrough` before stripping a variable.
